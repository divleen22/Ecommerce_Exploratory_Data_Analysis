# BigBasket Products Extrapolation Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and extrapolation of product data from BigBasket, an e-commerce platform. The goal of this project is to gain insights and predict patterns using advanced data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on extracting meaningful trends, performing extrapolations, and presenting actionable insights based on the product dataset. Key steps include data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and understanding trends in product data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Extrapolating data to forecast trends or fill gaps.
- **Visualizations:** Graphical representation of findings for better understanding.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifying key trends in product categories and pricing using Matplotlib visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes product details from BigBasket. Note that the dataset may not be included in this repository due to proprietary or privacy considerations.
